# Knickzettelspiel

The rules are simply: just continue the story from the previous player.

## Installation
```
# it is highly recommended to first create a virtual python and then a virtual node environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

## Development
```
# activate both virtual environments
python server.py
# open a separate terminal, activate again the environments
npm run serve
```
## Technology stack
- backend: Python using [`websockets`](https://websockets.readthedocs.io)
- frontend: Javascript using [`Vue`](https://v3.vuejs.org/) and [`Quasar`](https://quasar.dev/)
